          <p>Through GDSC, we want to foster the ability to give back to society with the use of technology through GDSC. It's a club where we learn and build new things with other curious developers, exhilarating everyone to their core. The goal is to establish an optimum learning environment on and around campus.</p>

          <h3>Central Philippine University</h3>
          <p>The origins of Central Philippine University dates back in 1901 when the American Northern Baptists, through its foreign mission board, the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society, laid a plan to establish mission schools following the comity agreement of the division of the islands for the evangelical mission and through a benevolent grant given by John D. Rockefeller, an American industrialist and philanthropist.</p>
